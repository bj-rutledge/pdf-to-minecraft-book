#- 1/5There Will Come Soft RainsBy: Ray BradburyIn the living room the voice-clock sang, Tick-tock, seven o'clock, time to get up, time to get up,seven o 'clock! as if it were afraid that nobody would. The morning house lay empty. The clockticked on,
#- repeating and repeating its sounds into the emptiness. Seven-nine, breakfast time,seven-nine!In the kitchen the breakfast stove gave a hissing sigh and ejected from its warm interior eight piecesof perfectly browned toast, eight eggs sunny side up, sixteen
#- slices of bacon, two coffees, and twocool glasses of milk."Today is August 4, 2026," said a second voice from the kitchen ceiling, "in the city ofAllendale, California." It repeated the date three times for memory's sake. "Today is Mr.Featherstone's
#- birthday. Today is the anniversary of Tilita's marriage. Insurance is payable,as are the water, gas, and light bills."Somewhere in the walls, relays clicked, memory tapes glided under electric eyes.Eight-one, tick-tock, eight-one o'clock, off to school,
#- off to work, run, run, eight-one! But nodoors slammed, no carpets took the soft tread of rubber heels. It was raining outside. The weatherbox on the front door sang quietly: "Rain, rain, go away; umbrellas, raincoats for today. .." Andthe rain tapped on
#- the empty house, echoing.Outside, the garage chimed and lifted its door to reveal the waiting car. After a long wait the doorswung down again.At eight-thirty the eggs were shrivelled and the toast was like stone. An aluminium wedge scrapedthem into the
#- sink, where hot water whirled them down a metal throat which digested and flushedthem away to the distant sea. The dirty dishes were dropped into a hot washer and emergedtwinkling dry.Nine-fifteen, sang the clock, time to clean.Out of warrens in the wall,
#- tiny robot mice darted. The rooms were a crawl with the small cleaninganimals, all rubber and metal. They thudded against chairs, whirling their moustached runners,kneading the rug nap, sucking gently at hidden dust. Then, like mysterious invaders, they
#- poppedinto their burrows. Their pink electric eyes faded. The house was clean.Ten o'clock. The sun came out from behind the rain. The house stood alone in a city of rubble andashes. This was the one house left standing. At night the ruined city gave off a
#- radioactive glowwhich could be seen for miles.Ten-fifteen. The garden sprinklers whirled up in golden founts, filling the soft morning air withscatterings of brightness. The water pelted window panes, running down the charred west side
#- 2/5where the house had been burned, evenly free of its white paint. The entire west face of the housewas black, save for five places. Here the silhouette in paint of a man mowing a lawn. Here, as in aphotograph, a woman bent to pick flowers. Still farther
#- over, their images burned on wood in onetitanic instant, a small boy, hands flung into the air; higher up, the image of a thrown ball, andopposite him a girl, hands raised to catch a ball which never came down.The five spots of paint - the man, the woman,
#- the children, the ball - remained. The rest was a thincharcoaled layer.The gentle sprinkler rain filled the garden with falling light.Until this day, how well the house had kept its peace. How carefully it had inquired, "Who goesthere? What's the
#- password?" and, getting no answer from lonely foxes and whining cats, it hadshut up its windows and drawn shades in an old-maidenly preoccupation with self-protection whichbordered on a mechanical paranoia.It quivered at each sound, the house did. If a
#- sparrow brushed a window, the shade snapped up.The bird, startled, flew off! No, not even a bird must touch the house!Twelve noon.A dog whined, shivering, on the front porch.The front door recognized the dog voice and opened. The dog, once huge and fleshy,
#- but nowgone to bone and covered with sores, moved in and through the house, tracking mud. Behind itwhirred angry mice, angry at having to pick up mud, angry at inconvenience.For not a leaf fragment blew under the door but what the wall panels flipped open
#- and the copperscrap rats flashed swiftly out. The offending dust, hair, or paper, seized in miniature steel jaws, wasraced back to the burrows. There, down tubes which fed into the cellar, it was dropped into thesighing vent of an incinerator which sat
#- like evil Baal in a dark corner.The dog ran upstairs, hysterically yelping to each door, at last realizing, as the house realized, thatonly silence was here.It sniffed the air and scratched the kitchen door. Behind the door, the stove was making
#- pancakeswhich filled the house with a rich baked odour and the scent of maple syrup.The dog frothed at the mouth, lying at the door, sniffing, its eyes turned to fire. It ran wildly incircles, biting at its tail, spun in a frenzy, and died. It lay in the
#- parlor for an hour.Two o'clock, sang a voice.Delicately sensing decay at last, the regiments of mice hummed out as softly as blown gray leaves inan electrical wind.Two-fifteen.
#- 3/5The dog was gone.In the cellar, the incinerator glowed suddenly and a whirl of sparks leaped up the chimney.Two thirty-five.Bridge tables sprouted from patio walls. Playing cards fluttered onto pads in a shower of pips.Martinis manifested on an oaken
#- bench with egg-salad sandwiches. Music played.But the tables were silent and the cards untouched.At four o'clock the tables folded like great butterflies back through the paneled walls .Four-thirty.The nursery walls glowed.Animals took shape: yellow
#- giraffes, blue lions, pink antelopes, lilac panthers cavorting in crystalsubstance. The walls were glass. They looked out upon color and fantasy. Hidden films clockedthrough well-oiled sprockets, and the walls lived. The nursery floor was woven to resemble
#- a crisp,cereal meadow. Over this ran aluminum roaches and iron crickets, and in the hot still air butterfliesof delicate red tissue wavered among the sharp aroma of animal spoors! There was the sound like agreat matted yellow hive of bees within a dark
#- bellows, the lazy bumble of a purring lion. And therewas the patter of okapi feet and the murmur of a fresh jungle rain, like other hoofs, falling upon thesummer-starched grass. Now the walls dissolved into distances of parched grass, mile on mile, andwarm
#- endless sky. The animals drew away into thorn brakes and water holes. It was the children'shour.Five o'clock. The bath filled with clear hot water.Six, seven, eight o'clock. The dinner dishes manipulated like magic tricks, and in the study a click.In the
#- metal stand opposite the hearth where a fire now blazed up warmly, a cigar popped out, halfan inch of soft gray ash on it, smoking, waiting.Nine o'clock. The beds warmed their hidden circuits, for nights were cool here.Nine-five. A voice spoke from the
#- study ceiling: "Mrs. McClellan, which poem would you likethis evening?" The house was silent.The voice said at last, "Since you express no preference, I shall select a poem at random."Quiet music rose to back the voice. "Sara Teasdale. As I recall, your
#- favourite...There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;And frogs in the pools singing at night,And wild plum trees in tremulous white;Robins will wear their feathery fire,
#- 4/5Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;And not one will know of the war, not oneWill care at last when it is done.Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,If mankind perished utterly;And Spring herself, when she woke at dawnWould scarcely know that
#- we were gone."The fire burned on the stone hearth and the cigar fell away into a mound of quiet ash on its tray. Theempty chairs faced each other between the silent walls, and the music played.At ten o'clock the house began to die.The wind blew. A falling
#- tree bough crashed through the kitchen window. Cleaning solvent, bottled,shattered over the stove. The room was ablaze in an instant!"Fire!" screamed a voice. The house lights flashed, water pumps shot water from the ceilings. Butthe solvent spread on the
#- linoleum, licking, eating, under the kit
