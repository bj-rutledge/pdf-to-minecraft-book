#- 1/5There Will Come Soft RainsBy: Ray BradburyIn the living room the voice-clock sang, Tick-tock, seven o'clock, time to get up, time to get up,seven o 'clock! as if it were afraid that nobody would. The morning house lay empty. The clockticked on, repeatin
#- g and repeating its sounds into the emptiness. Seven-nine, breakfast time,seven-nine!In the kitchen the breakfast stove gave a hissing sigh and ejected from its warm interior eight piecesof perfectly browned toast, eight eggs sunny side up, sixteen slices 
#- of bacon, two coffees, and twocool glasses of milk."Today is August 4, 2026," said a second voice from the kitchen ceiling, "in the city ofAllendale, California." It repeated the date three times for memory's sake. "Today is Mr.Featherstone's birthday. Tod
#- ay is the anniversary of Tilita's marriage. Insurance is payable,as are the water, gas, and light bills."Somewhere in the walls, relays clicked, memory tapes glided under electric eyes.Eight-one, tick-tock, eight-one o'clock, off to school, off to work, ru
#- n, run, eight-one! But nodoors slammed, no carpets took the soft tread of rubber heels. It was raining outside. The weatherbox on the front door sang quietly: "Rain, rain, go away; umbrellas, raincoats for today. .." Andthe rain tapped on the empty house, 
#- echoing.Outside, the garage chimed and lifted its door to reveal the waiting car. After a long wait the doorswung down again.At eight-thirty the eggs were shrivelled and the toast was like stone. An aluminium wedge scrapedthem into the sink, where hot wate
#- r whirled them down a metal throat which digested and flushedthem away to the distant sea. The dirty dishes were dropped into a hot washer and emergedtwinkling dry.Nine-fifteen, sang the clock, time to clean.Out of warrens in the wall, tiny robot mice dart
#- ed. The rooms were a crawl with the small cleaninganimals, all rubber and metal. They thudded against chairs, whirling their moustached runners,kneading the rug nap, sucking gently at hidden dust. Then, like mysterious invaders, they poppedinto their burro
#- ws. Their pink electric eyes faded. The house was clean.Ten o'clock. The sun came out from behind the rain. The house stood alone in a city of rubble andashes. This was the one house left standing. At night the ruined city gave off a radioactive glowwhich 
#- could be seen for miles.Ten-fifteen. The garden sprinklers whirled up in golden founts, filling the soft morning air withscatterings of brightness. The water pelted window panes, running down the charred west side
#- 2/5where the house had been burned, evenly free of its white paint. The entire west face of the housewas black, save for five places. Here the silhouette in paint of a man mowing a lawn. Here, as in aphotograph, a woman bent to pick flowers. Still farther 
#- over, their images burned on wood in onetitanic instant, a small boy, hands flung into the air; higher up, the image of a thrown ball, andopposite him a girl, hands raised to catch a ball which never came down.The five spots of paint - the man, the woman, 
#- the children, the ball - remained. The rest was a thincharcoaled layer.The gentle sprinkler rain filled the garden with falling light.Until this day, how well the house had kept its peace. How carefully it had inquired, "Who goesthere? What's the password?
#- " and, getting no answer from lonely foxes and whining cats, it hadshut up its windows and drawn shades in an old-maidenly preoccupation with self-protection whichbordered on a mechanical paranoia.It quivered at each sound, the house did. If a sparrow brus
#- hed a window, the shade snapped up.The bird, startled, flew off! No, not even a bird must touch the house!Twelve noon.A dog whined, shivering, on the front porch.The front door recognized the dog voice and opened. The dog, once huge and fleshy, but nowgone
#-  to bone and covered with sores, moved in and through the house, tracking mud. Behind itwhirred angry mice, angry at having to pick up mud, angry at inconvenience.For not a leaf fragment blew under the door but what the wall panels flipped open and the cop
#- perscrap rats flashed swiftly out. The offending dust, hair, or paper, seized in miniature steel jaws, wasraced back to the burrows. There, down tubes which fed into the cellar, it was dropped into thesighing vent of an incinerator which sat like evil Baal
#-  in a dark corner.The dog ran upstairs, hysterically yelping to each door, at last realizing, as the house realized, thatonly silence was here.It sniffed the air and scratched the kitchen door. Behind the door, the stove was making pancakeswhich filled the
#-  house with a rich baked odour and the scent of maple syrup.The dog frothed at the mouth, lying at the door, sniffing, its eyes turned to fire. It ran wildly incircles, biting at its tail, spun in a frenzy, and died. It lay in the parlor for an hour.Two o'
#- clock, sang a voice.Delicately sensing decay at last, the regiments of mice hummed out as softly as blown gray leaves inan electrical wind.Two-fifteen.
#- 3/5The dog was gone.In the cellar, the incinerator glowed suddenly and a whirl of sparks leaped up the chimney.Two thirty-five.Bridge tables sprouted from patio walls. Playing cards fluttered onto pads in a shower of pips.Martinis manifested on an oaken be
#- nch with egg-salad sandwiches. Music played.But the tables were silent and the cards untouched.At four o'clock the tables folded like great butterflies back through the paneled walls .Four-thirty.The nursery walls glowed.Animals took shape: yellow giraffes
#- , blue lions, pink antelopes, lilac panthers cavorting in crystalsubstance. The walls were glass. They looked out upon color and fantasy. Hidden films clockedthrough well-oiled sprockets, and the walls lived. The nursery floor was woven to resemble a crisp
#- ,cereal meadow. Over this ran aluminum roaches and iron crickets, and in the hot still air butterfliesof delicate red tissue wavered among the sharp aroma of animal spoors! There was the sound like agreat matted yellow hive of bees within a dark bellows, t
#- he lazy bumble of a purring lion. And therewas the patter of okapi feet and the murmur of a fresh jungle rain, like other hoofs, falling upon thesummer-starched grass. Now the walls dissolved into distances of parched grass, mile on mile, andwarm endless s
#- ky. The animals drew away into thorn brakes and water holes. It was the children'shour.Five o'clock. The bath filled with clear hot water.Six, seven, eight o'clock. The dinner dishes manipulated like magic tricks, and in the study a click.In the metal stan
#- d opposite the hearth where a fire now blazed up warmly, a cigar popped out, halfan inch of soft gray ash on it, smoking, waiting.Nine o'clock. The beds warmed their hidden circuits, for nights were cool here.Nine-five. A voice spoke from the study ceiling
#- : "Mrs. McClellan, which poem would you likethis evening?" The house was silent.The voice said at last, "Since you express no preference, I shall select a poem at random."Quiet music rose to back the voice. "Sara Teasdale. As I recall, your favourite...The
#- re will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;And frogs in the pools singing at night,And wild plum trees in tremulous white;Robins will wear their feathery fire,
#- 4/5Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;And not one will know of the war, not oneWill care at last when it is done.Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,If mankind perished utterly;And Spring herself, when she woke at dawnWould scarcely know that 
#- we were gone."The fire burned on the stone hearth and the cigar fell away into a mound of quiet ash on its tray. Theempty chairs faced each other between the silent walls, and the music played.At ten o'clock the house began to die.The wind blew. A falling 
#- tree bough crashed through the kitchen window. Cleaning solvent, bottled,shattered over the stove. The room was ablaze in an instant!"Fire!" screamed a voice. The house lights flashed, water pumps shot water from the ceilings. Butthe solvent spread on the 
#- linoleum, licking, eating, under the kitchen door, while the voices took itup in chorus: "Fire, fire, fire!"The house tried to save itself. Doors sprang tightly shut, but the windows were broken by the heatand the wind blew and sucked upon the fire.The hou
#- se gave ground as the fire in ten billion angry sparks moved with flaming ease from room toroom and then up the stairs. While scurrying water rats squeaked from the walls, pistolled theirwater, and ran for more. And the wall sprays let down showers of mech
#- anical rain.But too late. Somewhere, sighing, a pump shrugged to a stop. The quenching rain ceased. Thereserve water supply which had filled baths and washed dishes for many quiet days was gone.The fire crackled up the stairs. It fed upon Picassos and Mati
#- sses in the upper halls, like delicacies,baking off the oily flesh, tenderly crisping the canvases into black shavings.Now the fire lay in beds, stood in windows, changed the colors of drapes!And then, reinforcements. From attic trapdoors, blind robot face
#- s peered down with faucet mouthsgushing green chemical.The fire backed off, as even an elephant must at the sight of a dead snake.Now there were twenty snakes whipping over the floor, killing the fire with a clear cold venom ofgreen froth.But the fire was 
#- clever. It had sent flame outside the house, up through the attic to the pumps there.An explosion! The attic brain which directed the pumps was shattered into bronze shrapnel on thebeams.
#- 5/5The fire rushed back into every closet and felt of the clothes hung there.The house shuddered, oak bone on bone, its bared skeleton cringing from the heat, its wire, itsnerves revealed as if a surgeon had torn the skin off to let the red veins and capil
#- laries quiver in thescalded air. Help, help! Fire! Run, run! Heat snapped mirrors like the first brittle winter ice. Andthe voices wailed. Fire, fire, run, run, like a tragic nursery rhyme, a dozen voices, high, low, likechildren dying in a forest, alone, 
#- alone. And the voices fading as the wires popped their sheathingslike hot chestnuts. One, two, three, four, five voices died.In the nursery the jungle burned. Blue lions roared, purple giraffes bounded off. The panthers ran incircles, changing color, and t
#- en million animals, running before the fire, vanished off toward a distantsteaming river....  Ten more voices died.In the last instant under the fire avalanche, other choruses, oblivious, could be heard announcing thetime, cutting the lawn by remote-contro
#- l mower, or setting an umbrella frantically out and in, theslamming and opening front door, a thousand things happening, like a clock shop when each clockstrikes the hour insanely before or after the other, a scene of maniac confusion, yet unity; singing,s
#- creaming, a few last cleaning mice darting bravely out to carry the horrid ashes away! And onevoice, with sublime disregard for the situation, read poetry aloud in the fiery study, until all the filmspools burned, until all the wires withered and the circu
#- its cracked.The fire burst the house and let it slam flat down, puffing out skirts of spark and smoke.In the kitchen, an instant before the rain of fire and timber, the stove could be seen makingbreakfasts at a psychopathic rate, ten dozen eggs, six loaves
#-  of toast, twenty dozen bacon strips,which, eaten by fire, started the stove working again, hysterically hissing!The crash. The attic smashing into kitchen and parlour. The parlour into cellar, cellar into sub-cellar.Deep freeze, armchair, film tapes, circ
#- uits, beds, and all like skeletons thrown in a cluttered mounddeep under.Smoke and silence. A great quantity of smoke.Dawn showed faintly in the east. Among the ruins, one wall stood alone. Within the wall, a lastvoice said, over and over again and again, 
#- even as the sun rose to shine upon the heaped rubbleand steam:"Today is August 5, 2026, today is August 5, 2026, today is..."
